          <p>
            I received my BS degree at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" title=“”>University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in Computer Sciences, Economics, and Mathematics. I will attend MSCS program at Stanford University in 2022 Fall.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am interested in database systems and data of any kinds with their application, especially with machine learning, to other fields, such as Ecology, Conservation, and Biology, to try to solve challenging problems. I applied the analysis
            of acoustic data into the research of the marine ecosystem. I worked on the applications of neural network models in the classifications of animals and pseudomonas sequence data. I am also exploring the interdisciplinary between Computer Sciences and Economics.
