        <p>
          I am a Junior at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" title=“”>University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> triple majoring in Computer Sciences, Economics, and Mathematics. I am also pursuing the certificate of Art, Studio and focus in
          Graphic Design. I plan to graduate in 2021 Fall (December 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in the applications of Computer Sciences, especially data analysis and machine learning, to other fields to try to solve challenging problems. I applied the analysis of acoustic data into the research of the marine ecosystem. I am also
          exploring the interdisciplinary between Computer Sciences and Economics.
        </p>
        <p>
          From January 2020, I have the opportunity to utilize Machine Learning in the research on the rainforest biodiversity for the project “Tropical Stethoscope” in the <a href="https://www.soundforestlab.org/" target="_blank">Sound Forest Lab</a>          with professor
          <a href="https://www.soundforestlab.org/zuzana" target="_blank">Zuzana Burivalova</a>, collaborating with professor <a href="https://wid.wisc.edu/people/claudia-solis-lemus/" target="_blank">Claudia Solis Lemus</a> and professor <a href="https://wid.wisc.edu/people/daniel-pimentel-alarcon/"
            target="_blank">Daniel Pimentel Alarcon</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting in 2021 Spring, I will work towards my CS honor thesis advised by professor <a href="https://tzamos.com/" target="_blank">Christos Tzamos</a> and focus on Mechanism Design.
